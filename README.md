# Wikipedia Scraper
### BeCode - Data Science and AI Bootcamp - Project 2

This project fetches data about country leaders from https://country-leaders.onrender.com, fetches, cleans and adds a short introductory paragraph for each leader from their respective Wikipedia page.

The data is then saved in JSON format for easy access and later use.


## Project Structure
* `leaders_scraper.py`: The main script file that:
  * Fetches country and leader data from the API and stores in a dictionary
  * Retrieves and cleans the first paragraph of the Wikipedia article for each country leader and adds paragraph to the dictionary
  * Saves the data in a `leaders.json` file
* `wikipedia_scraper.ipynb`: The instructions and tasks for the project.

## Features
1. **API Data Retrieval:** The script connects to an API that provides information about country leaders, organized by country.
2. **Wikipedia Data Scraping and Cleaning:** For each leader, the script uses a session to retrieve and clean the first paragraph from their Wikipedia page.
3. **JSON Output:** The final data, in the format of a dictionary, organized by country and including the respective Wikipedia snippets, is saved as a JSON file.

## Usage

Run the script to fetch data about country leaders, retrieve a short Wikipedia introduction and save everything to a JSON file:

```python 
python leaders_scraper.py
```
